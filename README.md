# time-travel-sim

This is a template, designed to make using a particular method of cross-platform (desktop and web) development, in a new project, faster.

See below for build/run instructions, and see the `checklist` script for how to get started modifying a copy of the template to suit your needs.

## WASM version

### Running locally

1. Install Rust via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

2. Install WebAssembly target:
```
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
3. Start dev server:
```
cargo run-wasm time-travel-sim --release
```
4. Visit `http://localhost:8000` with your browser.

### Extra build options

These extra features can be adding then to the run-wasm `features` flag. Note that these are comma separated. For instance to activate `invariant-checking` and `logging` you can run:
```
cargo run-wasm time-travel-sim --release --features invariant-checking,logging
```
## Desktop

The desktop version attempts to be cross platform. Only Linux and Windows have been tested at this time.

### Building/Running

1. Install Rust via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

2. Build via cargo
```
cargo build --release --bin time-travel-sim
```
3. Run the executable
```
./target/release/time-travel-sim
```

#### Linux specific notes

When building the Linux version, some additional packages may be needed to support building the [`alsa`](https://github.com/diwic/alsa-rs) library this program uses for sound, on Linux.
On Ubuntu, these packages can be installed as follows:

```
sudo apt install libasound2-dev pkg-config
```

If you don't care about sound you can build with the enabled-by-default `"non-web-sound"` feature flag turned off:

```
cargo build --release --bin time-travel-sim --no-default-features
```

##### Wayland
As of this writing, [a library that this program uses does not allow specifying that parts of the screen need to be redrawn, on Wayland](https://github.com/john01dav/softbuffer/issues/9).
For now, you can run the executable with the `WINIT_UNIX_BACKEND` environment variable set to `"x11"` as a workaround.

```
WINIT_UNIX_BACKEND="x11" ./target/release/time-travel-sim
```

## Feature flags

##### invariant-checking

With this enabled violations of certain invariants will result in a panic. These checks are disabled in default mode since (presumably) a player would prefer the game doing something weird to outright crashing.

##### logging

Enables additional generic logging. With this feature disabled, the logs will be compiled out, leaving no appreciable run-time overhead.

##### non-web-sound

Enables sound when not building for the web. On by default.
